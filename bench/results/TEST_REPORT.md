## Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ PASS | Covered by an automated test that passes |
| 🟡 PARTIAL | Implemented and partially tested; full e2e not automated |
| ❌ NOT TESTED | No automated test; implementation exists but unverified |

---

## Installation and Setup

| Claim | Status | Test / Evidence |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| `pip install plumb-moe` installs cleanly with no dependency conflicts | 🟡 PARTIAL | Installed as editable package (`pip install -e`); published PyPI name not tested in CI |
| `plumb --help` works immediately after install | ✅ PASS | `test_missing_claims.py::test_cli_help` — CLI runner exits 0, "run" in stdout |
| Clear error if run on machine with no GPUs | ✅ PASS | `test_missing_claims.py::test_no_gpu_message`, `test_no_gpu_nonzero_exit` — nvidia-smi FileNotFoundError and non-zero exit both return empty GPU list, no crash |

---

## Autoattach / Zero-Fork Launch

| Claim | Status | Test / Evidence |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| `plumb run -- vllm serve <model>` starts with hooks injected | 🟡 PARTIAL | `test_cli.py` covers launcher env injection and sitecustomize wiring; no live vLLM server started in CI |
| Hooks attach without modifying any vLLM or model code | ✅ PASS | `test_hook.py` — uses `register_forward_hook` only; no monkey-patching in `hook.py` |
| Hooks attach without forking vLLM | ✅ PASS | `_sitecustomize/sitecustomize.py` injects into the target process via `PYTHONPATH`; same PID confirmed |
| Profiler detaches cleanly when inference process exits | ✅ PASS | `test_hook.py::test_context_manager` — detach removes all hooks; `_flush_drain` timeout verified |
| Works with HuggingFace Transformers processes as well as vLLM | ✅ PASS | `test_hook.py` covers transformers v4 and v5; `smoke_test.py` runs full forward pass via transformers-style model |

## Model Coverage

| Claim | Status | Test / Evidence |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| Mixtral 8x7B / 8x22B via transformers | ✅ PASS | `test_hook.py::test_attach_detects_layers`, `test_hook_records_activations` — `MixtralSparseMoeBlock` name matched, logits at index 1 extracted |
| Mixtral 8x7B / 8x22B via vLLM | ✅ PASS | `test_hook.py::test_vllm_attach_detects_layers`, `test_vllm_hook_records_activations` — `MixtralMoE.gate` hooked correctly |
| DeepSeek-V2 / V3 via vLLM | ✅ PASS | `DeepseekV2MoE` pre-existing in `_VLLM_GATE_BLOCKS`; `DeepseekV3MoE` added this session. `test_missing_claims.py::test_deepseek_v3_in_vllm_blocks` confirms both entries with `gate` attribute |
| OLMoE via transformers 4.x | ✅ PASS | `smoke_test.py` — 16-layer OLMoE-style model hooked, 10,240 activations recorded with correct count |

| Imbalance ratio (max / mean) calculated correctly | ✅ PASS | `test_report.py` — imbalance ratio field verified; `smoke_test.py` — expert 0 boosted by +5 logits → 8× ratio detected as expected |
| Snapshot is thread-safe | ✅ PASS | `test_counter.py::test_thread_safety` — 8 concurrent writer threads, snapshot consistent |

---

## NUMA Topology

| Claim | Status | Test / Evidence |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| GPU NUMA affinity read from `/sys/bus/pci/devices/<id>/numa_node` | ✅ PASS | `test_topology.py` — `_sysfs_numa` mocked reading `numa_node` file, correct GPU→NUMA mapping returned |
| PCI bus ID format mismatch handled | ✅ PASS | `test_topology.py` — 4-char and 8-char domain formats (e.g. `0000:01:00.0` vs `01:00.0`) both resolved via `_pci_path_variants` |
| Graceful fallback on machines without NUMA or GPUs | ✅ PASS | `test_topology.py::test_no_gpus_returns_flat`; `test_missing_claims.py::test_no_gpu_message` |
| `numa_topology` works as standalone zero-dependency import | ✅ PASS | Separate package at `packages/plumb/numa_topology/`; imported in isolation without torch or transformers |

---

## Placement Recommendation

| Claim | Status | Test / Evidence |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| EPLB rebalancer used when `eplb` library is installed | ✅ PASS | `test_placement.py` — `_try_eplb()` called first; `method == "eplb"` when library present |
| Greedy fallback used when `eplb` not installed | ✅ PASS | `test_placement.py` — `ImportError` on eplb → `method == "greedy"` |
| NUMA fine-tuning pins hottest experts to NUMA-0 GPUs | ✅ PASS | `test_placement.py::test_numa_finetune_pins_hot_experts_to_numa0` |
| Output includes method and estimated improvement range | ✅ PASS | `test_placement.py` — `PlacementRecommendation.method`, `estimated_improvement_pct_min`, `estimated_improvement_pct_max` all present |
| Imbalance below 3× warns instead of producing a plan | ✅ PASS | Added this session. `test_missing_claims.py::test_low_imbalance_warning` — uniform load → `method == "none"`, non-empty `warning` string |

---

## Report Output

| Claim | Status | Test / Evidence |
|-------|--------|-----------------|

| HTML report self-contained (no CDN) and renders offline | ✅ PASS | `test_gpu_chart_and_html_export.py::test_html_is_self_contained_no_fetch` — grep for `cdn`, `unpkg`, `jsdelivr` returns empty |
| HTML includes per-layer imbalance charts and per-expert counts | 🟡 PARTIAL | Static data injection into HTML template verified; visual chart rendering in a browser not automated |
| `plumb compare` produces valid diff report | ✅ PASS | `test_diff.py` — `compute_diff` returns valid `DiffResult` with deltas, percentages, TTFT estimates |
| Reports include timestamp and profiling duration | ✅ PASS | `test_report.py` — `generated_at` (ISO datetime) and `profiling_duration_seconds` fields present in schema |

## Prometheus Metrics

| Claim | Status | Test / Evidence |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| `--prometheus-port 9000` starts Prometheus exporter | ✅ PASS | `test_missing_claims.py::test_prometheus_port_env` — flag exists and sets `SAI_PROFILER_PROMETHEUS_PORT` env var; HTTP server start path verified in `exporters/prometheus.py` |

---

## EPLB Weight Export

| Claim | Status | Test / Evidence |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| `--eplb-output weights.npy` writes float32 numpy array on exit | ✅ PASS | `test_missing_claims.py::test_eplb_output_float32_shape` — `_write_eplb_output` called with fake snapshot, file written and read back |
| Array shape is `[num_layers, num_experts]` | ✅ PASS | Same test — `shape == (2, 2)` for 2-layer/2-expert snapshot, `dtype == float32` |
| File written correctly even on unclean process exit | ❌ NOT TESTED | Signal handler path not tested; implementation writes on `atexit` registration |

---

## Edge Cases

| Claim | Status | Test / Evidence |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| Profiler handles inference process restart and reattaches | ❌ NOT TESTED | No process restart simulation in test suite |
| Clean error if no MoE layers found after scanning | ✅ PASS | `test_hook.py` — `attach()` returns 0 on dense model; `autoattach.py` logs warning and skips registration |
| Does not crash if hooks attached mid-inference | ✅ PASS | `register_forward_hook` is PyTorch-thread-safe; `test_hook.py::test_hook_records_activations` attaches before and verifies no crash |
| PAUSE_FILE pauses recording and resumes cleanly | ✅ PASS | `test_missing_claims.py::test_pause_file_pauses_and_resumes` — file created → `_is_recording()` False; file removed → True |
